I repeat these words
again
Can I be stronger than my past?
Sometimes
I wonder
What I need to do
I tell myself
My little heart
I'm testing you

You don't need to say a word
Lift your eyes and
explore
night skies
with me
Let's go!

A future drawn by us lies just right down a path
A path that's long and far away is where it lies
The smiles we make
The tears we shed
Don't you think that they would be great to share?

Along the boundary of that bright distant sky
As long as there's a thing that is worth searching for
I'm not alone
I have you right here by my side
With strength to walk with you
