Take a step towards this vast and boundless world
Take a step out without fear
into this world where we can reach for the stars

This sparkling dream of yours,
why do you hide it so?
Remember how we have that wish dear and close to both of us?
We'll make tonight
a wish on a star

A star out of reach and far away
will fall to earth tonight
Let's close our eyes and make the wish
with all that we've got
And someday we will reach it
Let's not let our fears hold us back
