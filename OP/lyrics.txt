I look at the ground in front of me
I look at the sky that all can see
The future's ahead of us. It waits for us, you know
So let's keep moving forward and go!

Pursuing things I love, I want that for all time
I'd like to live my life without holding back
Toss my doubts and my fears. My unease, throw it all away
In the end, my courage remains

I look around me, up above, down below
The world is vast, so very vast, don't you know?

Looking for the things I've never seen
Going to the spots I've never been
The will to do all those things is what I want to have within
I look at the ground in front of me
I look at the sky that all can see
The future's ahead of us. It waits for us, you know
So let's keep moving forward and go!
